# Nikon Ekrynox SDK for NINA
This project is a [NINA](https://github.com/isbeorn/nina) plugin that brings a new alternative to the official Nikon SDK.

Based on [Nikon Ekrynox SDK (NEK)](https://github.com/Ekrynox/Nikon-Ekrynox-SDK-for-NINA), the plugin doesn't require you to install any custom drivers as it uses Windows Portable Device API for direct PTP/MTP communications.
